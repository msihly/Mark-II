This monorepo hosts both Mark II, a self-hosted Electron app replacement of the deprecated [OneMark](https://github.com/msihly/onemark) site, and a firefox add-on that replaces OneMark's [Chrome extension](https://github.com/msihly/onemark). The full history of this projects' iterations over the past several years are available on my GitHub for posterity.

This project is currently in an incomplete state as I've been rather busy lately and it is a lower priority for me, so there are no demos until I've had a chance to further refine and test it. This project is made public as a code-only example of recent alternative techniques and features compared to [Media Viewer](https://github.com/msihly/media-viewer), which this project adapts several components and features from.
